For years I had wire ratsnest with piece of proto-board for my AY-3-8910 (YM2149 actually) which was very flimsy and damage-prone.
Last X-mas holidays I drew PCB to embed everything into the computer case.
The the three PSG channels are mixed with SPKR ULA output and the resulting signal is amplified by class-D apmlifier and sent to reasonable quality speaker.

All IO's that are used in ZXS128k for serial ports are equipped with RS232 transceivers. The other IO port is connected directly to optional connector.
These IO ports are untested yet.

The PCB is soldered directly at the bottom side of ZX Spectrum mainboard to the CPU pins.
Pictures are in the connection_instructions folder.

License: Do anything what you want. My support will be very limited but you can try to ask me anything.

I have four unpopulated PCB's. First four of you can have it basically for shipment expenses. Contact me if interrested.
