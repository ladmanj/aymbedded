For years I had a wire nest with a piece of protoboard for my AY-3-8910 (actually YM2149) that was very flimsy and prone to damage.
Last Christmas break I drew the PCB to put everything in the computer case.
The three PSG channels are mixed with the output of the SPKR ULA and the resulting signal is amplified by a class-D amplifier and sent to a reasonable quality loudspeaker.

All IOs used in the ZXS128k for serial ports are equipped with RS232 transceivers. The second IO port is connected directly to the optional connector.
These IO ports are not yet tested.

The PCB is soldered directly on the underside of the ZX Spectrum motherboard to the CPU pins.
The images are in the connection_instructions folder.

License: Do what you want. My support will be very limited, but feel free to ask me anything.

I have four blank PCBs. The first four of you can basically have it for the cost of shipping. Please contact me if you are interested.
